# Perseid

Perseid is a GUI utility for finding meteor echoes in I/Q data. I wrote it for
the [Vancouver Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of
Canada](https://rasc-vancouver.com) as part of their amateur radio astronomy
initiative. See the [wiki](https://github.com/preston-thompson/perseid/wiki)
for information on how to use this software.
